# "Intuition" AI Project Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the **"Intuition" AI project**.

This project aims to equip AI with a form of intuitive reasoning, complementing its existing rational analysis capabilities. By analyzing historical events and data, the AI learns to recognize patterns and underlying laws. This allows it to generate intuitive predictions about future trends, much like human intuition is built from past experiences. This "intuition engine" is designed as a pluggable module to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in forecasting future scenarios based on historical patterns.

## Development
